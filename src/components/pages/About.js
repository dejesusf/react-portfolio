      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <p>My name is Feliclare De Jesus and I am a Student Full Stack Web Developer enrolled in the University of Washington Coding Bootcamp program. Also, you may call me Feli (it's like Kelly, but with an F).</p>

      <p>I was born and raised in Hawai'i, on the busy island of O'ahu. I miss going to the beach and just soaking in the sun and salty air on my days off. Nowadays, I lounge with my dogs, Miso and Yuri, streaming a show on Netflix and crocheting. I am a huge fan of Pokemon and have been since 1998!</p>

      <p>I recently moved to Washington in March 2020--right before quarantine. Washington is not new territory as I previously attended Washington State University as an undergraduate. That is where I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Biology. In 2018, I started my career in laboratory medicine.</p>

      <p>I've been employed with the University of Washington's Department of Laboratory Medicine & Pathology since 2020. My work as a Clinical Laboratory Technician has been fulfilling but I am looking for change. My strengths lie in frontend web design, however I am really excited to learn more of the backend portion of web development!</p>

      <p>Please checkout my <a href="./pages/portfolio.html">portfolio</a> and <a href="./pages/current-projects.html">ongoing projects</a> to see what I'm currently working on. You can also follow me on <a href="https://github.com/dejesusf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a>.</p>
