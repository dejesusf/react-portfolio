# React Portfolio

## Desription

This is my new portfolio using React. This assignment came at a good time because I was just recreating my portfolio! It's really rewarding to look back at week 2's assignment of this bootcamp and see how much I've progressed. I was able to render a professional portfolio that I'm proud of! Below is a screenshot of the portfolio upon opening.

Here's the [link](https://dejesusf.github.io/react-portfolio/) to the deployed portfolio.
